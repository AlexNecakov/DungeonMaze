# Dungeon Maze - 2019
This is the Cocos Creator and Android Studio project code for the Dungeon Maze game. This game was developed for my Introduction to Software Engineering undergrad course in collaboration with Peter Wallace, Isaac Yamnitsky, and Alex Jedrey. This game was developed in JavaScript, using the Cocos Creator engine for quick Android app creation and deployment. Included in this repository is the source code in the Cocos project, and a built version implemented as an Android App in an Android Studio project. The original README with additional build information is archived here as README old.md. My personal role on this project was lead Cocos developer and game designer. I was responsible for coordinating tasks between team members, and designing game mechanics and levels in Cocos Creator. The game itself uses the phone's built in IMU to control a ball through a maze (it's a labyrinth clone). There are several levels included.
